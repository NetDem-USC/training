# Networked Democracy Lab: Materials for Training Sessions

[NetDem](http://dornsife.usc.edu/labs/netdem) is an interdisciplinary research group based in the School of International Relations at the University of Southern California. Our research interests encompass social network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning. We apply these methods to the study of comparative political behavior, collective action, and political representation.

This repository contains the materials used during the training sessions on social media data collection and analysis, natural language processing, machine learning and others.
